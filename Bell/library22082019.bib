@article{Abadie2011,
abstract = {Around the globe several observatories are seeking the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves are predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity [Einstein, A., Annalen der Physik 49, 769-822 (1916)] and are generated e.g. by black-hole binary systems [Sathyaprakash, B. S. and Schutz, B. F., Living Rev. Relativity 12, 2 (2009)]. Current GW detectors are Michelson-type kilometer-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance changes between in vacuum suspended mirrors. The sensitivity of these detectors at frequencies above several hundred hertz is limited by the vacuum (zero-point) fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. A quantum technology - the injection of squeezed light [Caves, C. M., Phys. Rev. D 23, 1693-1708 (1981)] - offers a solution to this problem. Here we demonstrate the squeezed-light enhancement of GEO600, which will be the GW observatory operated by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration in its search for GWs for the next 3-4 years. GEO600 now operates with its best ever sensitivity, which proves the usefulness of quantum entanglement and the qualification of squeezed light as a key technology for future GW astronomy.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new scheme of infrared spectroscopy with visible light sources and detectors. The technique relies on the nonlinear interference of correlated photons, produced via spontaneous parametric down conversion in a nonlinear crystal. Visible and infrared photons are split into two paths and the infrared photons interact with the sample under study. The photons are reflected back to the crystal, resembling a conventional Michelson interferometer. Interference of the visible photons is observed and it is dependent on the phases of all three interacting photons: pump, visible and infrared. The transmission coefficient and the refractive index of the sample in the infrared range can be inferred from the interference pattern of visible photons. The method does not require the use of potentially expensive and inefficient infrared detectors and sources, it can be applied to a broad variety of samples, and it does not require a priori knowledge of sample properties in the visible range.},

abstract = {Environmental noise and disorder play a critical role in quantum particle and wave transport in complex media, including solid-state and biological systems. Recent work has predicted that coupling between noisy environments and disordered systems, in which coherent transport has been arrested due to localization effects, could actually enhance transport. Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal being the development of large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map out the role of static and dynamic disorder in quantum transport using a low-loss, phase-stable, nanophotonic processor consisting of a mesh of 56 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales. Over 85,600 transport experiments, we observe several distinct transport regimes, including environment-enhanced transport in strong, statically disordered systems. Low loss and programmability make this nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation experiments.},

abstract = {Third-harmonic generation in a hollow glass fiber has been demonstrated. Ti:sapphire laser pulses 100 fs with a moderate intensity of around 1 × 1014 W/cm2 are introduced into a 1.8-cm hollow fiber in room air. From the observation of the third-harmonic beam quality and spectra, it is clarified that the harmonics are pumped at the leading edge of the fundamental pulse. The model calculation accounting for the nonlinear refractive index change of air shows a quantitative agreement with the experimental results. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 1998.},

This crystal is scarcely used for resonator fabrication despite its numerous advantages, that are mainly high mechanical hardness, low sensitivity to water vapor pollution, and low sensitivity to photo- and thermo-refractive fluctuations at optimal temperatures. Using a customized machining procedure, we have successfully fabricated and characterized a 5-mm resonator with a surface rugosity of the order of 1 nm (from 3 to 12 atoms). Cavity ring-down measurements enabled us to determine that the resonator has a quality factor Q = 3.4 x 10(8) at 1550 nm.},

abstract = {We observe at record-high speed the nonclassical nature of ultra-broadband bi-photons, reducing the measurement time by four orders of magnitude compared to standard techniques of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference or sum-frequency generation. We measure the quantum state of the broadband bi-photons, amplitude and phase, with a pairwise "Mach-Zehnder" quantum interferometer, where bi-photons that are generated in one nonlinear crystal are enhanced (constructive interference) or diminished (destructive interference) in another crystal, depending on the bi-photon phase. We verify the quantum nature of the interference by observing the dependence of the fringe visibility on internal loss. Since destructive interference is equivalent to an attempt to annihilate in the second crystal (by up-conversion) the bi-photons that were created in the first crystal (by down-conversion), the fringe visibility is a measure for the quantum bi-photon purity of the broadband light. The measurement speed-up is due to the large homodyne-like gain from the strong pump ({\$}\backslash!\backslashsim\backslash!10{\^{}}{\{}7-9{\}}{\$}) in the up-conversion efficiency of single bi-photons, which enables the use of simple photo-detection of the full, ultra-high photon flux instead of single-photon / coincidence counting.},

While the polarization degree of freedom of the photon is a common choice for many studies, it is restricted to only two orthogonal states, hence qubits for manipulation. In this paper, we theoretically model as well as experimentally verify a novel scheme of approximating photonic qutrits by modulating the pump beam in a spontaneous parametric down conversion process using a three-slit aperture. The emerging bi-photon fields behave like qutrits and are found to be highly correlated in the spatial degree of freedom and effectively represent spatially correlated qutrits with a Pearson coefficient as high as 0.9. In principle, this system provides us a scalable architecture for generating and experimenting with higher dimensional correlated qudits.},

abstract = {The heralded generation of entangled states is a long-standing goal in quantum information processing, because it is indispensable for a number of quantum protocols. Polarization entangled photon pairs are usually generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but the emission is probabilistic. Their applications are generally accompanied by post-selection and destructive photon detection. Here, we report a source of entanglement generated in an event-ready manner by conditioned detection of auxiliary photons. This scheme benefits from the stable and robust properties of spontaneous parametric down-conversion and requires only modest experimental efforts. It is flexible and allows the preparation efficiency to be significantly improved by using beamsplitters with different transmission ratios. We have achieved a fidelity better than 87{\%} and a state preparation efficiency of 45{\%} for the source. This could offer promise in essential photonics-based quantum information tasks, and particularly in enabling optical quantum computing by reducing dramatically the computational overhead.},

abstract = {The Hilbert-Schmidt distance between two arbitrary normalizable states is discussed as a measure of the similarity of the states. Unitary transformations of both states with the same unitary operator (e.g. the displacement of both states in the phase plane by the same displacement vector and squeezing of both states) do not change this distance. The nearest distance of a given state to the whole set of coherent states is proposed as a quantitative measure of non-classicality of the state which is identical when considering the coherent states as the most classical ones among pure states and the deviations from them as non-classicality. The connection to other definitions of the nonclassicality of states is discussed. The notion of distance can also be used for the definition of a neighbourhood of considered states. Inequalities for the distance of states to Fock states are derived. For given neighbourhoods, they restrict common characteristics of the state as the dispersion of the number operator and the squared deviation of the mean values of the number operator for the considered state and the Fock state. Possible modifications in the definition of$\backslash$nnon-classicality for mixed states with dependence on the impurity parameter and by including the displaced thermal states as the most classical reference states are discussed. },

Here we report the nonlinear interaction between two single photons. Each photon is generated in independent parametric down-conversion sources. They are subsequently combined in a nonlinear waveguide where they are converted into a single photon of higher energy by the process of sum-frequency generation. Our approach results in the direct generation of photon triplets. More generally, it highlights the potential for quantum nonlinear optics with integrated devices and, as the photons are at telecom wavelengths, it opens the way towards novel applications in quantum communication such as device-independent quantum key distribution.},

In particular, a possibility for calculating the eigenfrequencies and geometry dependent dispersion of whispering gallery modes is important for optimization of dielectric microresonator-based Kerr frequency combs. In this case, the required anomalous second-order dispersion may be controlled by means of small shape variations of the resonator. Unfortunately, all uniform approximations for the eigenfrequencies do not reach the required precision for this purpose. We propose new approximations for spheroids, quartics, and toroids with better precision, which also allow for the estimation of the second-order dispersion. We also obtain analytical expressions for field distribution in microresonators and investigate the possibility of achieving better approximations by combining analytical and numerical methods.

abstract = {Seventy five years ago, three remarkable papers by Schr{\"{o}}dinger, Kennard and Darwin were published. They were devoted to the evolution of Gaussian wave packets for an oscillator, a free particle and a particle moving in uniform constant electric and magnetic fields. From the contemporary point of view, these packets can be considered as prototypes of the coherent and squeezed states, which are, in a sense, the cornerstones of modern quantum optics. Moreover, these states are frequently used in many other areas, from solid state physics to cosmology. This paper gives a review of studies performed in the field of so-called `nonclassical states' (squeezed states are their simplest representatives) over the past seventy five years, both in quantum optics and in other branches of quantum physics. My starting point is to elucidate who introduced different concepts, notions and terms, when, and what were the initial motivations of the authors. Many new references have been found which enlarge the `standard citation package' used by some authors, recovering many undeservedly forgotten (or unnoticed) papers and names. Since it is practically impossible to cite several thousand publications, I have tried to include mainly references to papers introducing new types of quantum states and studying their properties, omitting many publications devoted to applications and to the methods of generation and experimental schemes, which can be found in other well known reviews. I also mainly concentrate on the initial period, which terminated approximately at the border between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, when several fundamental experiments on the generation of squeezed states were performed and the first conferences devoted to squeezed and `nonclassical' states commenced. The 1990s are described in a more `squeezed' manner: I have confined myself to references to papers where some new concepts have been introduced, and to the most recent reviews or papers with extensive bibliographical lists.},

Two separate experiments are then conducted to characterize the performance of the coupler: one experiment measures the reflected signal from a single FTFT while the other adopts a two-FTFT coupling scheme and measures the transmission signal from a second FTFT. We obtained the comb-like eigenfrequency spectrum from both schemes. The measured free spectrum range (FSR) is around 2nm and the Q-factor is in the order of 105. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Whispering-gallery-mode microresonators are a promising cavity to study, due to the ability to obtain quality factors exceeding 100 million in micron-scale volumes. This thesis investigates the suitability of ultra-high-quality factor silica microresonators (both silica microspheres and silica toroidal microresonators) for nonlinear and quantum optics. Crucial to the actual use of these structures is the ability to efficiently excite and extract optical energy. The first part of this thesis investigates the ability to achieve near lossless coupling between a fiber-taper waveguide and a silica microresonator. It is shown that a coupling ideality (which is the fraction of energy coupled into the desired fiber mode) in excess of 99.97{\%} is possible, meaning that optical energy can be coupled both to and from the optical resonator with near perfect efficiency. Using tapered fibers, low threshold stimulated Raman scattering is observed in both silica microspheres and silica microtoroids at record low incident pump powers below 100 microwatts, much lower than previous devices. High conversion efficiencies ({\textgreater} 35{\%}) are also realized. Furthermore, the conditions for optimized performance of both stimulated Raman scattering and parametric oscillation in a microcavity are described. Lastly, the suitability of toroidal microcavities for strong coupling cavity quantum electro- dynamics is investigated. Numerical modeling of the optical modes demonstrates a significant reduction of modal volume with respect to spherical cavities, while retaining high quality factors. The extra degree of freedom of toroid microcavities can be used to achieve improved strong-coupling characteristics, and numerical results for atom-cavity coupling strength, critical atom number and critical photon numbers for cesium are calculated and shown to exceed values currently possible using Fabry-Perot cavities. Modeling predicts atom-cavity coupling rates exceeding 700 MHz and critical atom numbers approaching 10−7.},

abstract = {Decades ago, the losses of glasses in the near infrared (near-IR) were investigated in views of developments for optical telecommunications. Today, properties in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) are of interest for molecular spectroscopy applications. In particular, high-sensitivity spectroscopic techniques based on high-finesse mid-IR cavities hold high promise for medical applications. Due to exceptional purity and low losses, whispering gallery mode microresonators based on polished alkaline earth metal fluoride crystals (i.e the {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}XF{\_}2{\}}{\$} family, where X {\$}={\$} Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr,...) have attained ultra-high quality (Q) factor resonances (Q{\$}{\textgreater}{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\$}) in the near-IR and visible spectral ranges. Here we report for the first time ultra-high Q factors in the mid-IR using crystalline microresonators. Using an uncoated chalcogenide (ChG) tapered fiber, light from a continuous wave quantum cascade laser (QCL) is efficiently coupled to several crystalline microresonators at 4.4 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m wavelength. We measure the optical Q factor of fluoride crystals in the mid-IR using cavity ringdown technique. We observe that {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}MgF{\_}2{\}}{\$} microresonators feature quality factors that are very close to the fundamental absorption limit, as caused by the crystal's multiphonon absorption (Q{\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}7{\}}{\$}), in contrast to near-IR measurements far away from these fundamental limits. Due to lower multiphonon absorption in {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}BaF{\_}2{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}SrF{\_}2{\}}{\$}, we show that ultra-high quality factors of Q {\$}\backslashgeqslant{\$} 1.4 {\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\$} can be reached at 4.4 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. This corresponds to an optical finesse of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}F{\}}{\textgreater}{\$}4{\$}\backslashcdot{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}4{\}}{\$}, the highest value achieved for any type of mid-IR resonator to date, and a more than 10-fold improvement over the state-of-the-art. Such compact ultra-high Q crystalline microresonators provide a route for narrow linewidth frequency-stabilized QCL or mid-IR Kerr comb generation.},

The phase locking and coherence of the combs are experimentally monitored through the measurement of beat signal spectra. These phase-locked combs, which feature high coherence and wide spectral spans, are obtained with pump powers in the range of a few tens of mW.

abstract = {Optical frequency combs have revolutionized the field of frequency metrology within the last decade and have become enabling tools for atomic clocks, gas sensing and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. The rapidly increasing number of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators. Optical microresonator based comb generators bear promise in this regard. Critical to their future use as 'frequency markers', is however the absolute frequency stabilization of the optical comb spectrum. A powerful technique for this stabilization is self-referencing, which requires a spectrum that spans a full octave, i.e. a factor of two in frequency. In the case of mode locked lasers, overcoming the limited bandwidth has become possible only with the advent of photonic crystal fibres for supercontinuum generation. Here, we report for the first time the generation of an octave-spanning frequency comb directly from a toroidal microresonator on a silicon chip. The comb spectrum covers the wavelength range from 990 nm to 2170 nm and is retrieved from a continuous wave laser interacting with the modes of an ultra high Q microresonator, without relying on external broadening. Full tunability of the generated frequency comb over a bandwidth exceeding an entire free spectral range is demonstrated. This allows positioning of a frequency comb mode to any desired frequency within the comb bandwidth. The ability to derive octave spanning spectra from microresonator comb generators represents a key step towards achieving a radio-frequency to optical link on a chip, which could unify the fields of metrology with micro- and nano-photonics and enable entirely new devices that bring frequency metrology into a chip scale setting for compact applications such as space based optical clocks.},

abstract = {Optical parametric down-conversion has proven to be a valuable source of nonclassical light. The process is inherently able to produce twin-beam correlations along with individual intensity squeezing of either parametric beam, when pumped far above threshold. Here, we present for the first time the direct observation of intensity squeezing of -1.2 dB of each of the individual parametric beams in parametric down-conversion by use of a high quality whispering-gallery-mode disk resonator. In addition, we observed twin-beam quantum correlations of -2.7 dB with this cavity. Such resonators feature strong optical confinement and offer tunable coupling to an external optical field. This work exemplifies the potential of crystalline whispering-gallery-mode resonators for the generation of quantum light. The simplicity of this device makes the application of quantum light in various fields highly feasible.},

abstract = {Quantum information technology strongly relies on coupling of optical photons with narrowband quantum systems, such as quantum dots, color centers, and atomic systems. This coupling requires matching the optical wavelength and bandwidth to the desired system, which presents a considerable problem for most available sources of quantum light. Here we demonstrate coupling of alkali dipole transitions with a tunable source of photon pairs. Our source is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a triply-resonant whispering-gallery mode resonator. For this, we have developed novel wavelength tuning mechanisms, which allow for a coarse tuning to either cesium or rubidium wavelength with subsequent continuous fine-tuning to the desired transition. As a demonstration of the functionality of the source, we performed a heralded single photon measurement of the atomic decay. We present a major advance in controlling the spontaneous down-conversion process, which makes our bright source of single photons now compatible with a plethora of narrow-band resonant systems.},

The chapter illustrates this discussion by frequency locking an extended-cavity diode laser, reducing the linewidth to a few hertz relative to the cavity. The chapter concludes with an example in which the locking apparatus is modified for a cavity ring-down demonstration. Included are results showing the laser repetitively locking and unlocking to the cavity.},

We demonstrate a continuous-wave low-threshold resonant optical parametric oscillator with optical spectral span ranging from 0.36 to 1.6 $\mu$m. Harmonic generation is observed when a MgF2 microresonator characterized by quality factor approaching 1010 is pumped either at 780 nm, with a standard distributed-feedback semiconductor laser, or at 698 nm, with a reflective amplifier. Pump power does not exceed 25 mW. The nonlinear process is phase matched due to $\chi$(3)-facilitated interaction of different mode families of the resonator. The optical harmonics generated can be used to seed high-power visible lasers, generate correlated photon pairs, and perform spectroscopy measurements.},

In this letter, we report a novel broadband phase matching (PM) technique in high quality factor (Q) whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators made of birefringent crystalline materials. This technique relies on two interacting WGMs, one with constant and the other with spatially oscillating phase velocity. Thus, phase matching occurs cyclically. The technique can be implemented with a WGM resonator with its disk plane parallel to the optic axis of the crystal. With a single beta barium borate (BBO) resonator in that configuration, we experimentally demonstrated efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) to harmonic wavelengths from 780 nm in the near infrared to 317 nm in the ultraviolet (UV). The observed SHG conversion efficiency is as high as 4.6{\%} (mW)-1. This broadband PM technique opens a new way for nonlinear optics applications in WGM resonators. This work is also the first reported continuous wave UV generation by direct SHG in a WGM resonator},

abstract = {We generalize the procedure of entanglement swapping to obtain a scheme for manipulating entanglement in multiparticle systems. We describe how this scheme allows one to establish multiparticle entanglement between particles belonging to distant users in a communication network through a prior distribution of singlets followed by only local measurements. We show that this scheme can be regarded as a method of generating entangled states of many particles and compare it with existing schemes using simple quantum computational networks. We highlight the practical advantages of using a series of entanglement swappings during the distribution of entangled particles between two parties. Applications of multiparticle entangled states in cryptographic conferencing and in reading messages from more than one source through a single measurement are also described.},

@article{Bub2007,
abstract = {The subject of quantum information has its roots in the debate about conceptual issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics. The chapter discusses the quantum information, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum computation. Quantum information suggests a new way of resolving the foundational problems of quantum mechanics. The chapter reviews the basic elements of classical information theory and introduces the notion of the Shannon entropy of an information source and the fundamental idea of information compression in Shannon's source coding theorem. The significance of Shannon's source coding theorem lies is showing that there is an optimal or most efficient way of compressing messages produced by a source (assuming a certain idealization) in such a way that they can be reliably reconstructed by a receiver. The chapter explains the exploitation of entanglement as a channel for the reliable transmission of quantum information. The security of quantum key distribution depends on features of quantum information - no cloning, no information gain without disturbance, entanglement - that prevent an eavesdropper from secretly gaining information about the quantum communication between two parties. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Quantum-mechanical entanglement of three or four particles has been achieved experimentally, and has been used to demonstrate the extreme contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism. However, the realization of five-particle entanglement remains an experimental challenge. The ability to manipulate the entanglement of five or more particles is required for universal quantum error correction. Another key process in distributed quantum information processing, similar to encoding and decoding, is a teleportation protocol that we term 'open-destination' teleportation. An unknown quantum state of a single particle is teleported onto a superposition of N particles; at a later stage, this teleported state can be read out (for further applications) at any of the N particles, by a projection measurement on the remaining particles. Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of five-photon entanglement and open-destination teleportation (for N = 3). In the experiment, we use two entangled photon pairs to generate a four-photon entangled state, which is then combined with a single-photon state. Our experimental methods can be used for investigations of measurement-based quantum computation and multi-party quantum communication.},

abstract = {The quantum state of a single photon stands among the most fundamental and intriguing manifestations of quantum physics. At the same time single photons and pairs of single photons are important building blocks in the fields of linear optical based quantum computation and quantum repeater infrastructure. These fields possess enormous potential and much scientific and technological progress has been made in developing individual components, like quantum memories and photon sources using various physical implementations. However, further progress suffers from the lack of compatibility between these different components. Ultimately, one aims for a versatile source of single photons and photon pairs in order to overcome this hurdle of incompatibility. Such a photon source should allow for tuning of the spectral properties (wide wavelength range and narrow bandwidth) to address different implementations while retaining high efficiency. In addition, it should be able to bridge different wavelength regimes to make implementations compatible. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate such a versatile single photon and photon pair source based on the physics of whispering gallery resonators. A disk-shaped, monolithic and intrinsically stable resonator is made of lithium niobate and supports a cavity-assisted triply-resonant spontaneous parametric down-conversion process. Measurements show that photon pairs are efficiently generated in two highly tunable resonator modes. We verify wavelength tuning over 100 nm between both modes with a controllable bandwidth between 7.2 and 13 MHz. Heralding of single photons yields anti-bunching with {\$}g{\^{}}{\{}(2){\}}(0) {\textless} 0.2{\$}. This compact source provides unprecedented possibilities to couple to different physical quantum systems and renders it ideal for the implementation of quantum repeaters and optical quantum information processing.},

@article{Shugayev2014,
abstract = {Nonlinear interactions within compact, on-chip microring resonant cavities is a topic of increasing interest in current silicon photonics research. Frequency combs, one of the emerging nonlinear applications in microring optics, offers great potential from both scientific and practical perspectives. However, the mechanisms of comb formation appear to differ from traditional frequency combs formed by pulsed femtosecond lasers, and thus require detailed elucidation through theory and simulation. Here we propose a technique to mimic the accuracy of finite-difference time domain (FDTD) full wave nonlinear optical simulations with only a small fraction of the computational resources. Our new hybrid approach combines a single linear FDTD simulation of the key interaction parameters, then directly inserts them into a coupled-mode theory simulation. Comparison of the hybrid approach and full FDTD shows a good match both in frequency domain and in time domain. Thus, it retains the advantage of FDTD in terms of direct connection with experimental designs, while finishing much faster and sidestepping stability issues associated with direct simulation of nonlinear phenomena. The hybrid technique produces several key results explored in this paper, including: demonstrating that comb formation can occur with both anomalous and normal dispersion; suggesting a new mechanism for incoherent (Type II) frequency comb formation; and illustrating a method for creating soliton-like pulses in on-chip microresonators.},

abstract = {Silicon and germanium are perhaps the two most well-understood semiconductor materials in the context of solid state device technologies and more recently micromachining and nanotechnology. Meanwhile, these two materials are also important in the field of infrared lens design. Optical instruments designed for the wavelength range where these two materials are transmissive achieve best performance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures to enhance signal from the scene over instrument background radiation. In order to enable high quality lens designs using silicon and germanium at cryogenic temperatures, we have measured the absolute refractive index of multiple prisms of these two materials using the Cryogenic, High-Accuracy Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as a function of both wavelength and temperature. For silicon, we report absolute refractive index and thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K at wavelengths from 1.1 to 5.6 microns, while for germanium, we cover temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K and wavelengths from 1.9 to 5.5 microns. We compare our measurements with others in the literature and provide temperature-dependent Sellmeier coefficients based on our data to allow accurate interpolation of index to other wavelengths and temperatures. Citing the wide variety of values for the refractive indices of these two materials found in the literature, we reiterate the importance of measuring the refractive index of a sample from the same batch of raw material from which final optical components are cut when absolute accuracy greater than +/-5 x 10{\^{}}-3 is desired.},

The radial mode numbers q and the angular mode numbers p = ?-m are identified and labeled via far-field imaging. The polar mode numbers ? are determined unambiguously by fitting the frequency differences between individual whispering gallery modes (WGMs). This allows for the accurate determination of the geometry and the refractive index at different temperatures of the WGMR.

We achieve a true-coincidence-count to accidental-coincidence-count ratio greater than 10, when the photon-pair production rate is about 0.04/pulse. This represents a four-fold improvement over our previous results. The contribution of spontaneous Raman scattering, the primary cause of uncorrelated photons that degrades the fidelity of this source, is reduced by decreasing the wavelength detuning between the correlated photons and the pump photons and by using polarizers to remove the cross-polarized Raman-scattered photons. Excess Raman scattering could be further suppressed by cooling the silica fiber. Even without cooling the fiber, the achieved 10 to 1 ratio of true-coincidence to accidental-coincidence makes the fiber source of correlated photon-pairs a useful tool for realizing various quantum-communication protocols.

We observe an efficient modulation of light with coherent microwave pumping at 9 GHz with applied power of approximately 10 mW Used as a receiver, the modulator allows us to detect nanowatt microwave radiation. Preliminary results with a 33-GHz modulator prototype are also reported., We present a theoretical interpretation of the experimental results and discuss possible applications of the device.

The wavelength dependent loss increase, observed for plastic-coated fibers at 200{\&}{\#}176;C, is found to be irreversible. During heating, the absorption peak of second overtone of Ge-OH preferentially appeared. The dependence of the loss increase on temperature, heating time, and dopant is also examined. The loss increase level is strongly dependent on phosphorous concentration. The experimental results indicate that the loss increase is caused by chemical reactions between fiber constituent materials and hydrogen generated from coating materials. It is also confirmed that the heating test of secondary coated fiber is a practical, useful method to evaluate the hydroxyl loss increase of optical fibers.},

abstract = {We review the progress in the development of frequency converters based on three-wave mixing in whispering gallery resonators (WGRs). The theoretical description, given in a unified notation for all basic processes, reveals that the phase-matching condition known from conventional devices is replaced by several selection rules and, furthermore, the fact that conversion efficiencies of more than 25{\%} can be reached in the overcoupled regime only. Experimentally, the conversion efficiencies exceed 50{\%} already at milliwatt input powers. This is achieved, however, so far in bulk resonators only since today the on-chip devices have two orders of magnitude lower quality factors. Regarding the stability of the conversion process, one has to consider impurities left from the crystal growth and material specific effects like photoconductivity, photorefractivity, and pyroelectricity. The impressive experimental progress paves the way that micrometer-sized frequency converters based on WGRs will find the way out of the lab into real-world applications.},

A threefold decrease of the 3.15-eV luminescence band was revealed, whereas the 4.25-eV luminescence band was only slightly sensitive to densification. This shows that these two bands belong to different luminescence centers. A drastic growth of a new metastable absorption band near 7.3 eV was observed. The pressure-induced changes disappeared as a result of thermal annealing. These changes are discussed with respect to in-fiber grating phenomena.},

abstract = {We present a mechanical laser shutter design that utilizes a DC electric motor to rotate a blade which blocks and unblocks a light beam. The blade and the main body of the shutter are modeled with computer aided design (CAD) and are produced by 3D printing. Rubber flaps are used to limit the blade's range of motion, reducing vibrations and preventing undesirable blade oscillations. At its nominal operating voltage, the shutter achieves a switching speed of (1.22 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.02) m/s with 1 ms activation delay and 10 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}s jitter in its timing performance. The shutter design is simple, easy to replicate, and highly reliable, showing no failure or degradation in performance over more than {\$}10{\^{}}8{\$} cycles.},

abstract = {Rotary voice-coil motors from computer hard disk drives make excellent mechanical shutters for light beams. However, the complexity of the necessary electronic driving circuit can hinder their application. A new design is presented here, using a single integrated circuit originally intended for controlling dc motors. A digital input signal switches a unipolar power supply bidirectionally through the voice coil. Short high-current pulses are generated on the transitions to ensure rapid shutter action, while a low holding current reduces the power requirement and heating of the actuator. The circuit can reverse the current to brake the shutter and reduce the impact at the end of its travel. With a focused laser beam, the shutter achieves rise times below 500 ns. A method for producing variable length pulses is also described, demonstrating durations as short as 700 ns.},

abstract = {The 4 crystal symmetry in materials such as GaAs can enable quasi-phasematching for efficient optical frequency conversion without poling, twinning or other engineered domain inversions. 4 symmetry means that a 90° rotation is equivalent to a crystallographic inversion. Therefore, when light circulates about the 4 axis, as in GaAs whispering-gallery-mode microdisks, it encounters effective domain inversions that can produce quasi-phasematching. Microdisk resonators also offer resonant field enhancement, resulting in highly efficient frequency conversion in micrometre-scale volumes. These devices can be integrated in photonic circuits as compact frequency convertors, sources of radiation or entangled photons. Here we present the first experimental observation of second-harmonic generation in a whispering-gallery-mode microcavity utilizing -quasi-phasematching. We use a tapered fibre to couple into the 5-$\mu$m diameter microdisk resonator, resulting in a normalized conversion efficiency $\eta$≈5 × 10(-5)mW(-1). Simulations indicate that when accounting for fibre-cavity scattering, the normalized conversion efficiency is $\eta$≈3 × 10(-3)mW(-1).},

We predict a generation efficiency of 0.13 triplets/s/mW of pump power in TiO2-based integrated waveguides, an order of magnitude higher than previous theoretical and experimental demonstrations.

We demonstrate high-fidelity self-calibrating tomography on polarization-encoded one- and two-photon states. The unknown unitary operations are realized in two ways: using a birefringent polymer sheet—an inexpensive smartphone screen protector—or alternatively a liquid crystal wave plate with a tuneable retardance.

abstract = {Producing advanced quantum states of light is a priority in quantum information technologies. While remarkable progress has been made on single photons and photon pairs, multipartite correlated photon states are usually produced in purely optical systems by post-selection or cascading, with extremely low efficiency and exponentially poor scaling. Multipartite states enable improved tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics as well as implementations of complex quantum optical networks and protocols. It would be favorable to directly generate these states using solid state systems, for better scaling, simpler handling, and the promise of reversible transfer of quantum information between stationary and flying qubits. Here we use the ground states of two optically active coupled quantum dots to directly produce photon triplets. The wavefunctions of photogenerated excitons localized in these ground states are correlated via molecular hybridization and Coulomb interactions. The formation of a triexciton leads to a triple cascade recombination and sequential emission of three photons with strong correlations. The quantum dot molecule is embedded in an epitaxially grown nanowire engineered for single-mode waveguiding and improved extraction efficiency at the emission wavelength. We record 65.62 photon triplets per minute, surpassing rates of all earlier reported sources, in spite of the moderate efficiency of our detectors. Our structure and data represent a breakthrough towards implementing multipartite photon entanglement and multi-qubit readout schemes in solid state devices, suitable for integrated quantum information processing.},

The calculation of such a triphoton W state is performed with second-order perturbation theory. To characterize the optical properties of the state, we analyze the two-photon and three-photon temporal correlations in the photon coincidence counting measurement. Considering the role of determining the time coherence of triphotons between the nonlinear susceptibilities and phase matchings, we concentrate on two regimes, damped Rabi oscillation and group delay, to look at the temporal correlations. To further enhance the nonlinear interactions, it may be promising to consider cold atoms confined within hollow fibers or loaded into a high-Q cavity.},

We address the practical questions, which one faces in any experimental application: the influence of technical noise, and behavior of the tomographic algorithm for an easy to implement class of factorized measurements. In an experiment with polarization states of entangled photon pairs we observe a lower instrumental noise floor and superior reconstruction accuracy for nearly-pure states of the adaptive protocol compared to a non-adaptive. At the same time we show, that for the mixed states the restriction to factorized measurements results in no advantage for adaptive measurements, so general measurements have to be used.},

@article{Shalm2013,
abstract = {Entangled quantum particles have correlations stronger than those allowed by classical physics. These correlations are the focus of of the deepest issues in quantum mechanics [1-3] and are the basis of many quantum technologies. The entanglement of discrete particle properties has been studied extensively in the context of quantum computing [4], cryptography [5], and quantum repeaters [6] while entanglement between the continuous properties of particles may play a critical role in improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors [7,8], atomic clocks [9], and other high precision instruments. The attributes of three or more entangled particles are fundamentally different from those of two entangled particles [10-14]. While the discrete variables of up to 14 ions [15] and the continuous variables between three intense optical beams [16, 17] have been entangled, it has remained an open challenge to entangle the continuous properties of more than two individual particles. Here we experimentally demonstrate genuine tripartite continuous-variable entanglement between three separated particles. In our setup the three particles are photons created directly from a single input photon; the creation process leads to quantum correlations between the colours, or energies, and emission times of the photons. The entanglement between our three photons is the three-party generalization of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) [1] correlations for continuous variables, and allows for new fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to be carried out. Our scheme can be extended to carry out multi-particle Franson interferometry [18,19], and opens the possibility of using additional degrees of freedom in our photons to simultaneously engineer discrete and continuous-variable hyper-entangled states that could serve as a valuable resource in a wide variety of quantum information tasks.},

@article{Adair1989,
abstract = {The nonlinear refractive indices (n2) of a large number of optical crystals have been measured at a wavelength near one micrometer with use of nearly degenerate three-wave mixing. The measurements are compared with the predictions of an empirical formula derived by Boling, Glass, and Owyoung. This formula, which relates n2 to the linear refractive index and its dispersion, is shown to be accurate to within about 30{\%} for materials with nonlinear indices ranging over 3 orders of magnitude. Measurements for a number of binary oxide and fluoride crystals have been analyzed under the assumption that the hyperpolarizability of the anion is much larger than that of the cation. It is found that the hyperpolarizability of oxygen varies by a factor of 10, and that of fluorine varies by a factor of 7, depending on the size of the coordinating cation. This behavior is similar to that of the linear polarizability, although the hyperpolarizability is much more sensitive than the linear polarizability to the identity of the cation. The measured halide ion hyperpolarizabilities for several alkali-halide crystals are in reasonable agreement with recent self-consistent calculations. A semiempirical model was proposed by Wilson and Curtis to account for the dependence of the linear anionic polarizability on the radius of the cation. This model also accounts quite well for the variation of the hyperpolarizability of both fluorine and oxygen, except for cation partners that have filled or unfilled d-electron shells. The nonlinear indices of a number of complex oxides (i.e., those with more than one cation) have been calculated from the partial hyperpolarizabilities deduced from the data for the binary oxides. The calculated and measured values of n2 agree to within an average error of 13{\%}.},

abstract = {This paper explains how a popular commercially available software package for solving partial-differential-equations (PDEs), as based on the finite-element method, can be configured to efficiently calculate the frequencies and fields of the whispering-gallery (WG) modes of axisymmetric dielectric resonators. The approach is traceable; it exploits the PDE-solver's ability to accept the definition of solutions to Maxwell's equations in so-called weak form. Associated expressions and methods for estimating a WG mode's volume, filling factor(s), and in the case of closed (open) resonators, its wall (radiation) loss, are provided. As no transverse approximation is imposed, the approach remains accurate even for quasi-transverse-magnetic/electric modes of low finite azimuthal mode order. The approach's generality and utility are demonstrated by modeling several nontrivial structures, i.e., 1) two different optical microcavities (one toroidal made of silica, the other an AlGaAs microdisk), 2) a third-order sapphire:air Bragg cavity, and 3) two different cryogenic sapphire WG-mode resonators; both 2) and 3) operate in the microwave X-band. By fitting one of 3) to a set of measured resonance frequencies, the dielectric constants of sapphire at liquid-helium temperature have been estimated.},

abstract = {The worldwide decline in honeybee colonies during the past 50 years has often been linked to the spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses. Recently in the United States, dramatic honeybee losses (colony collapse disorder) have been reported; however, there remains no clear explanation for these colony losses, with parasitic mites, viruses, bacteria, and fungal diseases all being proposed as possible candidates. Common characteristics that most failing colonies share is a lack of overt disease symptoms and the disappearance of workers from what appears to be normally functioning colonies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to monitor the presence of three honeybee viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV), during a 1-year period in 15 asymptomatic, varroa mite-positive honeybee colonies in Southern England, and 3 asymptomatic colonies confirmed to be varroa mite free. All colonies with varroa mites underwent control treatments to ensure that mite populations remained low throughout the study. Despite this, multiple virus infections were detected, yet a significant correlation was observed only between DWV viral load and overwintering colony losses. The long-held view has been that DWV is relatively harmless to the overall health status of honeybee colonies unless it is in association with severe varroa mite infestations. Our findings suggest that DWV can potentially act independently of varroa mites to bring about colony losses. Therefore, DWV may be a major factor in overwintering colony losses.},

We then discuss the influence of various parameters related to the optical fiber, to the harsh environments and to the fiber-based applications on the amplitudes and kinetics of these changes. Then, we focus on advances obtained over the last years. We summarize the main results regarding the fiber vulnerability and hardening to radiative constraints associated with several facilities such as Megajoule class lasers, ITER, LHC, nuclear power plants or with space applications.

@article{Kajihara2011,
abstract = {Point defects strongly influence optical properties of synthetic amorphous silica (synthetic a-SiO2 ) used in excimer laser photolithography and their properties are intensively studied. Decomposition of an Si-O-Si bond into a pair of oxygen vacancy and interstitial oxygen species is an intrinsic defect process in a-SiO2 . It is similar to the creation of vacancy-interstitial pairs in crystalline materials and is regarded as “Frenkel defect process” in an amorphous material. Oxygens are also known to be emitted from a-SiO2 surfaces under irradiation with vacuumultraviolet (VUV) light or electron beam. However, the anion part of the Frenkel pair in a-SiO2 , interstitial oxygen atom, lacks reliable spectroscopic signatures. Therefore, Frenkel process has been studied much less than another intrinsic defect process in a-SiO2 , a simple cleavage of an Si-O bond, yielding a pair of silicon and oxygen dangling bonds. Interstitial oxygen molecule (O2 ), a common form of the interstitial oxygen species in a-SiO2 , exhibits characteristic infrared photoluminescence (PL) at 1272 nm. This PL band allows interstitial O2 to be detected selectively with a high sensitivity, and is useful in studying Frenkel defect processes in both a-SiO2 and crystalline SiO2 . The Frenkel process is dominant over the formation of the dangling bond pairs in highpurity synthetic a-SiO2 . Both these processes are influenced by the degree of the structural disorder of a-SiO2 characterized by distribution of Si-O-Si angles. Fluorine doping promotes the structural relaxation and is useful in decreasing the concentration of “strained” Si-O-Si bonds, which have Si-O-Si bond angles widely different from the relaxed angle and are vulnerable to radiation. Moderate fluorine doping is effective in improving both UV-VUV transparency and radiation hardness, whereas heavy fluorine doping tends to enhance defect processes involving the Frenkel mechanism and to degrade the radiation hardness.},

The induced absorption is measured in the blue and near ultraviolet spectral range by using the 3.1 eV photoluminescence, ascribed to Ge lone pair center (GLPC), as an in situ probe source. We find that the Ge(1) center (GeO-(4) ) is induced upon UV exposure by electron trapping on GeO(4) precursors, where the free electrons are most likely produced by ionization of GLPC. Ge(1) is responsible of optical transmission loss of the fiber in the investigated range. Hydrogen loading strongly influences the generation efficiency of the several observed paramagnetic defects, leading in particular to passivation of radiation-induced Ge(2) centers.},

Experimental evidences indicate that diffusing molecular hydrogen (H2) depopulates by a collisional mechanism the triplet state, decreasing both its lifetime of about 14{\%} and the associated triplet PL intensity, whereas those of the singlet are insensitive to the presence of H2. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@phdthesis{Messina2007,
abstract = {This experimental PhD work deals with the generation and transformation processes of point defects induced by UV laser irradiation on amorphous silicon dioxide (silica). The investigation relies on several spectroscopic techniques used to probe the microscopic damage induced by UV laser on the material. The most innovative approach, however, is the measurement in situ of the absorption signals related to laser-induced point defects. This technique yields new information on the kinetics of defect processes, inaccessible to previous works based only on stationary measurements of laser-induced damage. The main result is to show that a major damage mechanism of silica under 4.7eV laser radiation is the generation of E' centers (silicon dangling bond defects) by photolysis of pre-existing Si-H bonds. This process occurs by two-photon absorption of laser light, and the produced E' centers are unstable in a wide temperature range: in fact, rupture of Si-H produces hydrogen atoms H together with E'; hence, H atoms dimerize in H{\_}2, which diffuses in the glass and reacts back with the E' centers causing their decay. The generation and decay kinetics of laser-induced E' centers are quantitatively modelled by considering the competition between the laser-induced breakage of Si-H and the concurrent reaction between E' and H{\_}2. The latter reaction is studied in detail at several temperatures: some of its features are found to be affected by the disorder of the glass matrix; moreover, its kinetics is found to be activation-limited rather than diffusion-limited, contrary to what is usually found for the reactions of diffusing species with point defects.},

abstract = {We compare the CW 244 nm laser induced absorption and photoluminescence excitation changes in Ge and Ge-P doped silica glass according to H2 loading. Under H2 loading only, the absorption does not change but the luminescence excitation intensity decreases by 60{\%}. For samples not H2 loaded, luminescence excited in the UV range is annihilated by the laser irradiation but not the absorption in the same UV range. During UV irradiation of H2 loaded samples most of the luminescence excited in the UV range disappears whereas UV absorption behaves differently. In that way, we show that defects giving rise to luminescence exhibit a weak contribution to the absorption spectrum. In particular, there are two different oxygen deficient centres: one absorbing at 5 eV and another one giving rise to luminescence under 5 eV excitation. Due to some correlations existing sometimes between absorption and luminescence, we suggest that luminescence is quenched by trapping of electrons produced by 5 eV absorbing defects. In addition, the use of a CW laser allows us to observe two successive one-photon absorption steps for accounting for the absorption change: a singlet to singlet transition and then an ionisation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Thpheoretical computer scientists, like their counterparts in physics, suffer and benefit from a high level of intellectual machismo. They believe they have some of the biggest brains around, which they need to think about some of the hardest problems. Like mathematicians, they prove theorems and doubt the seriousness of those who don{\&}apos;t. Lately, however, theoreticalcomputer scientists have sought the help of physicists in understanding quantum mechanics, a hard part of physics which they now believe has great significance for their own field. A new quantum theory of communication and computation is emerging, in which the stuff transmitted or processed is not classical information, but arbitrary superpositions of quantum states.},

We demonstrate the universality and usefulness of generic parity measurements, as well as introducing the use of redundant encoding of qubits to enable utilization of destructive measurements--both features of use in a more general context.},

@article{Hubel2010,
abstract = {Non-classical states of light, such as entangled photon pairs and number states, are essential for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and optical quantum technologies. The most widespread technique for creating these quantum resources is spontaneous parametric down-conversion of laser light into photon pairs. Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known as phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations that are used to produce two-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom. It has been a longstanding goal in quantum optics to realize a source that can produce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches considered, none has been technically feasible. Here we report the observation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Each triplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum correlations will extend over all three photons in a way not achievable with independently created photon pairs. Our photon-triplet source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum correlations, the generation of tripartite entanglement without post-selection and the generation of heralded entangled photon pairs suitable for linear optical quantum computing. Two of the triplet photons have a wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, suitable for three-party quantum communication. Furthermore, our results open interesting regimes of non-linear optics, as we observe spontaneous down-conversion pumped by single photons, an interaction also highly relevant to optical quantum computing.},

abstract = {A phase-only hologram applies a modal transformation to an optical transverse spatial mode via phase encoding and intensity masking. Accurate control of the optical field crucially depends on the method employed to encode the hologram. In this Letter, we present a method to encode the amplitude and the phase of an optical field into a phase-only hologram, which allows the exact control of spatial transverse modes. Any intensity masking method modulates the amplitude and alters the phase of the optical field. Our method consists in correcting for this unwanted phase alteration by modifying the phase encryption accordingly. We experimentally verify the accuracy of our method by applying it to the generation and detection of transverse spatial modes in mutually unbiased bases of dimension two and three.},

@article{Malik2014,
abstract = {The measurement of a quantum state poses a unique challenge for experimentalists. Recently, the technique of 'direct measurement' was proposed for characterizing a quantum state in situ through sequential weak and strong measurements. While this method has been used for measuring polarization states, its real potential lies in the measurement of states with a large dimensionality. Here we show the practical direct measurement of a high-dimensional state vector in the discrete basis of orbital angular momentum. Through weak measurements of orbital angular momentum and strong measurements of angular position, we measure the complex probability amplitudes of a pure state with a dimensionality, d=27. Further, we use our method to directly observe the relationship between rotations of a state vector and the relative phase between its orbital-angular-momentum components. Our technique has important applications in high-dimensional classical and quantum information systems and can be extended to characterize other types of large quantum states.},

@article{Abouraddy2001,
abstract = {We propose a new technique, called quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT), for carrying out tomographic measurements with dispersion-cancelled resolution. The technique can also be used to extract the frequency-dependent refractive index of the medium. QOCT makes use of a two-photon interferometer in which a swept delay permits a coincidence interferogram to be traced. The technique bears a resemblance to classical optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, it makes use of a nonclassical entangled twin-photon light source that permits measurements to be made at depths greater than those accessible via OCT, which suffers from the deleterious effects of sample dispersion. Aside from the dispersion cancellation, QOCT offers higher sensitivity than OCT as well as an enhancement of resolution by a factor of 2 for the same source bandwidth. QOCT and OCT are compared using an idealized sample.},

abstract = {We investigate the amplitude and intensity spatiotemporal coherence and the photon coincidence rates of far-field down-converted light resulting from the interaction of a pump wave of finite spectral width with a nonlinear crystal of finite spatial width. We examine the interplay between energy and phase mismatches and their effects on the intrabeam and interbeam spatial and temporal coherence of the down-converted beams. We show that the down-converted light is spatially incoherent in the second order, and that the signal-idler fourth-order coherence extends over finite entanglement angles. We also study the effect of the apertures through which the down-converted light is collected, when they are centered at phase-matched or misaligned directions.},

We refined the dispersion equations of rutile and we demonstrated that this crystal allows angular non critical phase-matching at useful wavelengths, with a figure of merit 7.5 times that of KTiOPO(4). The measured cubic non linear coefficient and the corresponding Miller coefficients are : chi(16) =5.0x10(-21) m(2/)V(2) at 613.2 nm and Delta16 = 3.5x10(-24) m(2/)V(2). These results are used to predict the phase-matching conditions and the efficiency of triple photon generation in rutile.},

We derive a set of two-photon mode functions that provide an exact, discrete, and effectively finite basis for characterizing pairwise entanglement. Our analysis provides a basis for entropy control in two-photon pulses generated from down-conversion.},

@article{Gaebel2006,
abstract = {Coherent coupling between single quantum objects is at the very heart of modern quantum physics. When the coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it can be used to engineer quantum entangled states. Entangled states have attracted widespread attention because of applications to quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. For such applications, solid-state hosts are preferred for scalability reasons, and spins are the preferred quantum system in solids because they offer long coherence times. Here we show that a single pair of strongly coupled spins in diamond, associated with a nitrogen-vacancy defect and a nitrogen atom, respectively, can be optically initialized and read out at room temperature. To effect this strong coupling, close proximity of the two spins is required, but large distances from other spins are needed to avoid deleterious decoherence. These requirements were reconciled by implanting molecular nitrogen into high-purity diamond.},

As the principal quantum number n was increased beyond {\~{}}70, no more than a single excitation was retrieved from the entire mesoscopic ensemble of atoms. These results hold promise for studies of dynamics and disorder in many-body systems with tunable interactions and for scalable quantum information networks.},

abstract = {We propose a protocol for perfect quantum state transfer that is resilient to a broad class of realistic experimental imperfections, including noise sources that could be modeled either as independent Markovian baths or as certain forms of spatially correlated environments. We highlight interesting connections between the fidelity of state transfer and quantum stochastic resonance effects. The scheme is flexible enough to act as an effective entangling gate for the generation of genuine multipartite entanglement in a control-limited setting. Possible experimental implementations using superconducting qubits are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Single spins in solid-state systems are often considered prime candidates for the storage of quantum information, and their interaction with the environment the main limiting factor for the realization of such schemes. The lifetime of an excited spin state is a sensitive measure of this interaction, but extending the spatial resolution of spin relaxation measurements to the atomic scale has been a challenge. We show how a scanning tunneling microscope can measure electron spin relaxation times of individual atoms adsorbed on a surface using an all-electronic pump-probe measurement scheme. The spin relaxation times of individual Fe-Cu dimers were found to vary between 50 and 250 nanoseconds. Our method can in principle be generalized to monitor the temporal evolution of other dynamical systems.},

abstract = {Fluorescent nanodiamond is a new nanomaterial that possesses several useful properties, including good biocompatibility, excellent photostability and facile surface functionalizability. Moreover, when excited by a laser, defect centres within the nanodiamond emit photons that are capable of penetrating tissue, making them well suited for biological imaging applications. Here, we show that bright fluorescent nanodiamonds can be produced in large quantities by irradiating synthetic diamond nanocrystallites with helium ions. The fluorescence is sufficiently bright and stable to allow three-dimensional tracking of a single particle within the cell by means of either one- or two-photon-excited fluorescence microscopy. The excellent photophysical characteristics are maintained for particles as small as 25 nm, suggesting that fluorescent nanodiamond is an ideal probe for long-term tracking and imaging in vivo, with good temporal and spatial resolution.},

We demonstrate conditional dynamics for two coupled quantum dots, whereby the probability that one quantum dot makes a transition to an optically excited state is controlled by the presence or absence of an optical excitation in the neighboring dot. Interaction between the dots is mediated by the tunnel coupling between optically excited states and can be optically gated by applying a laser field of the right frequency. Our results represent substantial progress toward realization of an optically effected controlled-phase gate between two solid-state qubits.},

(C(8)OPc)(2)Ce (1), (C(12)OPc)(2)Ce (2), and (C(8)OPc)Ce(Pc) (3) double-decker complexes, of which two ligands contained Pc nuclei, formed well-ordered self-organized structures on their own. Square-shaped top Pc ligands were clearly observed for complexes 1, 2, and 3 even though free space presented around the top ligands caused by mixing the complexes with template molecules. However, the details of the shapes of the top ligands of complexes 1, 2, and 3 were changed by the surrounding environment. The surrounding environment was considered to have influenced the mobility of the top ligands. Another complex, (C(8)OPc)Ce(TPP) (4), had difficulty forming a self-organized structure by itself. Complex 4 could have been immobilized by coadsorbing on the substrate with the C(8)OPc template, but the intramolecular structure of the top ligands of complex 4 was difficult to observe. The results strongly suggested that combinations of molecules composed of double-decker complexes as well as the free space presented around a top ligand are important factors that control the molecular motion of immobilized double-decker complexes on solid surfaces.},

We combined bottom-up atomic fabrication with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy to construct and read out atomic-scale model systems performing logic operations. Our concept uses substrate-mediated indirect exchange coupling to achieve logical interconnection between individual atomic spins. Combined with spin frustration, this concept enables various logical operations between inputs, such as NOT and OR.},

abstract = {Robust measurement of single quantum bits plays a key role in the realization of quantum computation and communication as well as in quantum metrology and sensing. We have implemented a method for the improved readout of single electronic spin qubits in solid-state systems. The method makes use of quantum logic operations on a system consisting of a single electronic spin and several proximal nuclear spin ancillae in order to repetitively readout the state of the electronic spin. Using coherent manipulation of a single nitrogen vacancy center in room-temperature diamond, full quantum control of an electronic-nuclear system consisting of up to three spins was achieved. We took advantage of a single nuclear-spin memory in order to obtain a 10-fold enhancement in the signal amplitude of the electronic spin readout. We also present a two-level, concatenated procedure to improve the readout by use of a pair of nuclear spin ancillae, an important step toward the realization of robust quantum information processors using electronic- and nuclear-spin qubits. Our technique can be used to improve the sensitivity and speed of spin-based nanoscale diamond magnetometers.},

abstract = {One proposal for a solid-state-based quantum bit (qubit) is to control coupled electron spins on adjacent semiconductor quantum dots. Most experiments have focused on quantum dots made from III-V semiconductors; however, the coherence of electron spins in these materials is limited by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins. Ge/Si core/shell nanowires seem ideally suited to overcome this limitation, because the most abundant nuclei in Ge and Si have spin zero and the nanowires can be chemically synthesized defect-free with tunable properties. Here, we present a double quantum dot based on Ge/Si nanowires in which we can completely control the coupling between the dots and to the leads. We also demonstrate that charge on the double dot can be detected by coupling it capacitively to an adjacent nanowire quantum dot. The double quantum dot and integrated charge sensor serve as an essential building block to form a solid-state qubit free of nuclear spin.},

abstract = {Silicon is one of the most promising semiconductor materials for spin-based information processing devices. Its advanced fabrication technology facilitates the transition from individual devices to large-scale processors, and the availability of a (28)Si form with no magnetic nuclei overcomes a primary source of spin decoherence in many other materials. Nevertheless, the coherence lifetimes of electron spins in the solid state have typically remained several orders of magnitude lower than that achieved in isolated high-vacuum systems such as trapped ions. Here we examine electron spin coherence of donors in pure (28)Si material (residual (29)Si concentration {\textless}50 ppm) with donor densities of 10(14)-10(15) cm(-3). We elucidate three mechanisms for spin decoherence, active at different temperatures, and extract a coherence lifetime T(2) up to 2 s. In this regime, we find the electron spin is sensitive to interactions with other donor electron spins separated by {\~{}}200 nm. A magnetic field gradient suppresses such interactions, producing an extrapolated electron spin T(2) of 10 s at 1.8 K. These coherence lifetimes are without peer in the solid state and comparable to high-vacuum qubits, making electron spins of donors in silicon ideal components of quantum computers, or quantum memories for systems such as superconducting qubits.},

The natural operation of the module is to generate states within the stabilizer formalism and we present an analysis on the cavity requirements to experimentally realize this device.},

Although several approaches allow for detection of a spin of single atoms and molecules, multiple repetitions of the experiment that are usually required for achieving a detectable signal obscure the intrinsic quantum nature of the spin's behavior. We demonstrated single-shot, projective measurement of a single nuclear spin in diamond using a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme, which allows real-time observation of an individual nuclear spin's state in a room-temperature solid. Such an ideal measurement is crucial for realization of, for example, quantum error correction protocols in a quantum register.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, strong interactions of light and matter at the single-photon level have enabled a wide set of scientific advances in quantum optics and quantum information science. This work has been performed principally within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics with diverse physical systems, including single atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators, quantum dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities and Cooper pairs interacting with superconducting resonators. Experiments with single, localized atoms have been at the forefront of these advances with the use of optical resonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations. As a result of the extreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer dielectric mirror coatings of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers of devices, there has been increased interest in the development of alternative microcavity systems. Here we show strong coupling between individual caesium atoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From observations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's evanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near the surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our observations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of coherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity. Our work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single atoms and photons in lithographically fabricated microresonators. Applications include the implementation of quantum networks, scalable quantum logic with photons, and quantum information processing on atom chips.},

abstract = {Quantum information science attempts to exploit capabilities from the quantum realm to accomplish tasks that are otherwise impossible in the classical domain. Although sufficient conditions have been formulated for the physical resources required to achieve quantum computation and communication, there is a growing understanding of the power of quantum measurement combined with the conditional evolution of quantum states for accomplishing diverse tasks in quantum information science. For example, a protocol has recently been developed for the realization of scalable long-distance quantum communication and the distribution of entanglement over quantum networks. Here we report the first enabling step in the realization of this protocol, namely the observation of quantum correlations for photon pairs generated in the collective emission from an atomic ensemble. The nonclassical character of the fields is demonstrated by the violation of an inequality involving their normalized correlation functions. Compared to previous investigations of non-classical correlations for photon pairs produced in atomic cascades and in parametric down-conversion, our experiment is distinct in that the correlated photons are separated by a programmable time interval (of about 400 nanoseconds in our initial experiments).},

abstract = {The development of a robust light source that emits one photon at a time will allow new technologies such as secure communication through quantum cryptography. Devices based on fluorescent dye molecules, quantum dots and carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated, but none has combined a high single-photon flux with stable, room-temperature operation. Luminescent centres in diamond have recently emerged as a stable alternative, and, in the case of nitrogen-vacancy centres, offer spin quantum bits with optical readout. However, these luminescent centres in bulk diamond crystals have the disadvantage of low photon out-coupling. Here, we demonstrate a single-photon source composed of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in a diamond nanowire, which produces ten times greater flux than bulk diamond devices, while using ten times less power. This result enables a new class of devices for photonic and quantum information processing based on nanostructured diamond, and could have a broader impact in nanoelectromechanical systems, sensing and scanning probe microscopy.},

abstract = {A fundamental step towards atomic- or molecular-scale spintronic devices has recently been made by demonstrating that the spin of an individual atom deposited on a surface, or of a small paramagnetic molecule embedded in a nanojunction, can be externally controlled. An appealing next step is the extension of such a capability to the field of information storage, by taking advantage of the magnetic bistability and rich quantum behaviour of single-molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, a proof of concept that the magnetic memory effect is retained when SMMs are chemically anchored to a metallic surface was provided. However, control of the nanoscale organization of these complex systems is required for SMMs to be integrated into molecular spintronic devices. Here we show that a preferential orientation of Fe(4) complexes on a gold surface can be achieved by chemical tailoring. As a result, the most striking quantum feature of SMMs-their stepped hysteresis loop, which results from resonant quantum tunnelling of the magnetization-can be clearly detected using synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques. With the aid of multiple theoretical approaches, we relate the angular dependence of the quantum tunnelling resonances to the adsorption geometry, and demonstrate that molecules predominantly lie with their easy axes close to the surface normal. Our findings prove that the quantum spin dynamics can be observed in SMMs chemically grafted to surfaces, and offer a tool to reveal the organization of matter at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {We propose a novel method for generating broadband spontaneous parametric fluorescence by using a set of bulk nonlinear crystals (NLCs). We also demonstrate this scheme experimentally. Our method employs a superposition of spontaneous parametric fluorescence spectra generated using multiple bulk NLCs. A typical bandwidth of 160 nm (73 THz) with a degenerate wavelength of 808 nm was achieved using two beta-barium-borate (BBO) crystals, whereas a typical bandwidth of 75 nm (34 THz) was realized using a single BBO crystal. We also observed coincidence counts of generated photon pairs in a non-collinear configuration. The bandwidth could be further broadened by increasing the number of NLCs. Our demonstration suggests that a set of four BBO crystals could realize a bandwidth of approximately 215 nm (100 THz).We also discuss the stability of Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference between the parametric fluorescence generated by this scheme. Our simple scheme is easy to implement with conventional NLCs and does not require special devices.},

When mechanical resonators are scaled down to nanometer-scale dimensions, these forces can be harnessed to enable coupling to individual quantum systems. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a single electronic spin associated with a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond can be coupled to the motion of a magnetized mechanical resonator. Coherent manipulation of the spin is used to sense driven and Brownian motion of the resonator under ambient conditions with a precision below 6 picometers. With future improvements, this technique could be used to detect mechanical zero-point fluctuations, realize strong spin-phonon coupling at a single quantum level, and implement quantum spin transducers.},

Experimental evaluation of the search algorithm revealed bounds for the accuracies of answers to other large, computationally complex problems and suggested methods for the optimization of DNA computations in general. Short oligonucleotide substrates performed substantially better than longer substrates. Large, computationally complex problems whose evaluation requires hybridization and ligation can likely best be encoded and evaluated using short oligonucleotides at mesophilic temperatures.},

For example, the coherent distribution of entangled quantum states together with quantum memory (for storing the states) can enable scalable architectures for quantum computation, communication and metrology. Here we report observations of entanglement between two atomic ensembles located in distinct, spatially separated set-ups. Quantum interference in the detection of a photon emitted by one of the samples projects the otherwise independent ensembles into an entangled state with one joint excitation stored remotely in 10(5) atoms at each site. After a programmable delay, we confirm entanglement by mapping the state of the atoms to optical fields and measuring mutual coherences and photon statistics for these fields. We thereby determine a quantitative lower bound for the entanglement of the joint state of the ensembles. Our observations represent significant progress in the ability to distribute and store entangled quantum states.},

abstract = {Individual nitrogen-vacancy defect centers have been investigated by low-temperature confocal microscopy and fluorescence excitation spectroscopy. At temperatures below 90 K the fluorescence intensity of individual centers drastically diminishes because of the population of a metastable singlet state in near resonance with the optically excited state. Low-temperature fluorescence excitation spectroscopy down to 5 K becomes possible via deshelving of this state with a second laser source. Surprisingly individual centers reveal low-temperature fluorescence excitation line widths around 0.6 meV, more than two orders of magnitude larger than expected from previous high resolution laser spectroscopy on bulk samples.

abstract = {Shor and Grover demonstrated that a quantum computer can outperform any classical computer in factoring numbers and in searching a database by exploiting the parallelism of quantum mechanics. Whereas Shor's algorithm requires both superposition and entanglement of a many-particle system, the superposition of single-particle quantum states is sufficient for Grover's algorithm. Recently, the latter has been successfully implemented using Rydberg atoms. Here we propose an implementation of Grover's algorithm that uses molecular magnets, which are solid-state systems with a large spin; their spin eigenstates make them natural candidates for single-particle systems. We show theoretically that molecular magnets can be used to build dense and efficient memory devices based on the Grover algorithm. In particular, one single crystal can serve as a storage unit of a dynamic random access memory device. Fast electron spin resonance pulses can be used to decode and read out stored numbers of up to 105, with access times as short as 10-10 seconds. We show that our proposal should be feasible using the molecular magnets Fe8 and Mn12.},

Метод основан на приложении градиента постоянного электрического поля к нелинейному кристаллу, в котором происходит рассеяние. При этом за счет электрооптического эффекта, т.е. зависимости показателей преломления от величины приложенного поля, условия фазового синхронизма различаются по длине кристалла. Как следствие модифицируется спектр излучаемого двухфотонного поля.},

The density matrix is retrieved from a two-dimensional interferogram of coincidence counts. The method has been implemented for a type-I down-conversion source, pumped by ultrashort laser pulses. The experimental results agree well with a theoretical model which takes into account the temporal as well as spatial effects in the source.},

We calculate analytical expressions for the fidelities of spectral and spread-spectral teleportation when complex-valued Gaussian states are transferred using a proposed experimental approach.

A sharp rise in the decoherence rate is observed at magnetic fields where the nitrogen-vacancy center spin couples resonantly to substitutional nitrogen spins via the magnetic dipolar coupling. Finally, we find evidence that away from these energy resonances spin flips of nitrogen electrons are the main source of decoherence.},

abstract = {Developments in quantum information science rely critically on entanglement-a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that causes parts of a composite system to show correlations stronger than can be explained classically. In particular, scalable quantum networks require the capability to create, store and distribute entanglement among distant matter nodes by means of photonic channels. Atomic ensembles can play the role of such nodes. So far, in the photon-counting regime, heralded entanglement between atomic ensembles has been successfully demonstrated through probabilistic protocols. But an inherent drawback of this approach is the compromise between the amount of entanglement and its preparation probability, leading to intrinsically low count rates for high entanglement. Here we report a protocol where entanglement between two atomic ensembles is created by coherent mapping of an entangled state of light. By splitting a single photon and performing subsequent state transfer, we separate the generation of entanglement and its storage. After a programmable delay, the stored entanglement is mapped back into photonic modes with overall efficiency of 17{\%}. Together with improvements in single-photon sources, our protocol will allow 'on-demand' entanglement of atomic ensembles, a powerful resource for quantum information science.},

abstract = {Two-level systems are at the core of numerous real-world technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging and atomic clocks. Coherent control of the state is achieved with an oscillating field that drives dynamics at a rate determined by its amplitude. As the strength of the field is increased, a different regime emerges where linear scaling of the manipulation rate breaks down and complex dynamics are expected. By calibrating the spin rotation with an adiabatic passage, we have measured the room-temperature "strong-driving" dynamics of a single nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. With an adiabatic passage to calibrate the spin rotation, we observed dynamics on sub-nanosecond time scales. Contrary to conventional thinking, this breakdown of the rotating wave approximation provides opportunities for time-optimal quantum control of a single spin.},

abstract = {Complete libraries of oligonucleotides were used as substrates for Thermus thermophilus DNA ligase, on a M13mp18 ssDNA template. A 17mer primer was used to start a polymerisation process. Ladders of ligation products were analysed by gel electrophoresis. Octa-, nona- and decanucleotide libraries were compared. Nonanucleotides were optimum for polymerisation and up to 15 monomers were ligated. The fidelity of incorporation was studied by sequencing 28 clones (2268 bases) of nonanucleotide polymers, 12 monomers in length. Of the ligated monomers, 79{\%} were the correct complementary sequence. In a total of 57 (2.5{\%}) mispaired bases, there was a strong bias to G.T, G.A, G.G and A.G mismatches. Of the mismatches, 86{\%} were found to be purines on the incoming oligonucleotide, of which 71{\%} were G. There is evidence for clustering of mismatches within specific 9mers and at specific positions within these 9mers. The most frequent mismatches were at the 5'-terminus of the oligonucleotide, followed by the central position. We suggest that sequence selection was imposed by the ligase and not just by base pairing interactions. The ligase directs polymerisation in the 3' to 5' direction which we propose is linked to its role in lagging strand DNA replication.},

Among the possibilities in the solid state, a defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV(-1)) center stands out for its robustness--its quantum state can be initialized, manipulated, and measured with high fidelity at room temperature. Here we describe how to systematically identify other deep center defects with similar quantum-mechanical properties. We present a list of physical criteria that these centers and their hosts should meet and explain how these requirements can be used in conjunction with electronic structure theory to intelligently sort through candidate defect systems. To illustrate these points in detail, we compare electronic structure calculations of the NV(-1) center in diamond with those of several deep centers in 4H silicon carbide (SiC). We then discuss the proposed criteria for similar defects in other tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors.},

Photonic channels appear to be very attractive for the physical implementation of quantum communication. However, owing to losses and decoherence in the channel, the communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. Here we describe a scheme that allows the implementation of robust quantum communication over long lossy channels. The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate efficiencies, and is therefore compatible with current experimental technology. We show that the communication efficiency scales polynomially with the channel length, and hence the scheme should be operable over very long distances.},

abstract = {We investigate in detail the optimal conditions for a high fidelity transfer from a single polariton state to a single photon state and subsequent homodyne detection of the single photon. We assume that, using various possible techniques, the single polariton has initially been stored as a spin-wave grating in a cloud of cold atoms inside a low-finesse cavity. This state is then transferred to a single photon optical pulse using an auxiliary beam. We optimize the retrieval efficiency and determine the mode of the local oscillator that maximizes the homodyne efficiency of such a photon. We find that both efficiencies can have values close to one in a large region of experimental parameters.},

abstract = {As quantum mechanics ventures into the world of applications and engineering, materials science faces the necessity to design matter to quantum grade purity. For such materials, quantum effects define their physical behaviour and open completely new (quantum) perspectives for applications. Carbon-based materials are particularly good examples, highlighted by the fascinating quantum properties of, for example, nanotubes or graphene. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of ultrapure isotopically controlled single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond with a remarkably low concentration of paramagnetic impurities. The content of nuclear spins associated with the (13)C isotope was depleted to 0.3{\%} and the concentration of other paramagnetic defects was measured to be {\textless}10(13) cm(-3). Being placed in such a spin-free lattice, single electron spins show the longest room-temperature spin dephasing times ever observed in solid-state systems (T2=1.8 ms). This benchmark will potentially allow observation of coherent coupling between spins separated by a few tens of nanometres, making it a versatile material for room-temperature quantum information processing devices. We also show that single electron spins in the same isotopically engineered CVD diamond can be used to detect external magnetic fields with a sensitivity reaching 4 nT Hz(-1/2) and subnanometre spatial resolution.},

В отличие от широко используемых кремниевых фотодетекторов в диапазоне длин волн до 1 мкм, работающих в ждущем режиме, данные детекторы всегда работают в режиме стробирования. При рождении электрон-дырочной пары при поглощении фотона, затем появлении лавины носителей возможен обратный процесс - рекомбинации и излучения фотонов. Такое обратное излучение может представлять потенциально серьезную проблему для стойкости волоконно-оптических систем квантовой криптографии при пассивном зондировании. Приводятся результаты исследования по регистрации обратного излучения. Приведена оценка для вероятности такого излучения.},

Перепутывание достигается путем когерентного наложения пар, излученных из двух нелинейных кристаллов, причем поляризация бифотонов, полученных из первого кристалла, меняется с помощью преобразователя, помещенного между двумя кристаллами.

@article{Vandersypen2001,
abstract = {The number of steps any classical computer requires in order to find the prime factors of an l-digit integer N increases exponentially with l, at least using algorithms known at present. Factoring large integers is therefore conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the security of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of N = 15 (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a molecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to store quantum information is in principle scalable to systems containing many quantum bits, but such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of our work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular, we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects in our system.},

abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond has potential applications in nanoscale electric and magnetic-field sensing, single-photon microscopy, quantum information processing and bioimaging. These applications rely on the ability to position a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within a few nanometres of a sample, and then scan it across the sample surface, while preserving the centre's spin coherence and readout fidelity. However, existing scanning techniques, which use a single diamond nanocrystal grafted onto the tip of a scanning probe microscope, suffer from short spin coherence times due to poor crystal quality, and from inefficient far-field collection of the fluorescence from the nitrogen-vacancy centre. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for scanning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within tens of nanometres from a sample surface that addresses both of these concerns. This is achieved by positioning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre at the end of a high-purity diamond nanopillar, which we use as the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our approach ensures long nitrogen-vacancy spin coherence times (∼75 µs), enhanced nitrogen-vacancy collection efficiencies due to waveguiding, and mechanical robustness of the device (several weeks of scanning time). We are able to image magnetic domains with widths of 25 nm, and demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of 56 nT Hz(-1/2) at a frequency of 33 kHz, which is unprecedented for scanning nitrogen-vacancy centres.},

Here, we review the first progress in the resulting field, molecular spintronics, which will enable the manipulation of spin and charges in electronic devices containing one or more molecules. We discuss the advantages over more conventional materials, and the potential applications in information storage and processing. We also outline current challenges in the field, and propose convenient schemes to overcome them.},

Simulation results using the ﬁnite element method show that a thin conducting layer can effectively increase the coupling coefﬁcient and, thus, broaden the bandwidth of SAW devices. For the Sezawa mode, it is illustrated that using a Ti layer with a layer thickness-to-wavelength ratio of 0.02 the maximum coupling coefﬁcient is 2.546{\%} and the associated SAW phase velocity is 10657 m/s at the AlN ﬁlms' thickness-to-wavelength ratio of 0.14. This coupling coefﬁcient is 105{\%} higher than that in the IDT/AlN/diamond structure. The research results can be applied to design SAW devices using diamond based structures in the super high frequency band.},

abstract = {We study both experimentally and theoretically the generation of photon pairs by spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in standard birefringent optical fibers. The ability to produce a range of two-photon spectral states, from highly correlated (entangled) to completely factorable, by means of cross-polarized birefringent phase matching, is explored. A simple model is developed to predict the spectral state of the photon pair which shows how this can be adjusted by choosing the appropriate pump bandwidth, fiber length and birefringence. Spontaneous Raman scattering is modeled to determine the tradeoff between SFWM and background Raman noise, and the predicted results are shown to agree with experimental data.},

abstract = {A significant development in computing has been the discovery that the computational power of quantum computers exceeds that of Turing machines. Central to the experimental realization of quantum information processing is the construction of fault-tolerant quantum logic gates. Their operation requires conditional quantum dynamics, in which one sub-system undergoes a coherent evolution that depends on the quantum state of another sub-system; in particular, the evolving sub-system may acquire a conditional phase shift. Although conventionally dynamic in origin, phase shifts can also be geometric. Conditional geometric (or 'Berry') phases depend only on the geometry of the path executed, and are therefore resilient to certain types of errors; this suggests the possibility of an intrinsically fault-tolerant way of performing quantum gate operations. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have already been used to demonstrate both simple quantum information processing and geometric phase shifts. Here we combine these ideas by performing a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment in which a conditional Berry phase is implemented, demonstrating a controlled phase shift gate.},

abstract = {The term 'molecular magnet' generally refers to a molecular entity containing several magnetic ions whose coupled spins generate a collective spin, S (ref. 1). Such complex multi-spin systems provide attractive targets for the study of quantum effects at the mesoscopic scale. In these molecules, the large energy barriers between collective spin states can be crossed by thermal activation or quantum tunnelling, depending on the temperature or an applied magnetic field. There is the hope that these mesoscopic spin states can be harnessed for the realization of quantum bits--'qubits', the basic building blocks of a quantum computer--based on molecular magnets. But strong decoherence must be overcome if the envisaged applications are to become practical. Here we report the observation and analysis of Rabi oscillations (quantum oscillations resulting from the coherent absorption and emission of photons driven by an electromagnetic wave) of a molecular magnet in a hybrid system, in which discrete and well-separated magnetic clusters are embedded in a self-organized non-magnetic environment. Each cluster contains 15 antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 spins, leading to an S = 1/2 collective ground state. When this system is placed into a resonant cavity, the microwave field induces oscillatory transitions between the ground and excited collective spin states, indicative of long-lived quantum coherence. The present observation of quantum oscillations suggests that low-dimension self-organized qubit networks having coherence times of the order of 100 micros (at liquid helium temperatures) are a realistic prospect.},

abstract = {Initialization and read-out of coupled quantum systems are essential ingredients for the implementation of quantum algorithms. Single-shot read-out of the state of a multi-quantum-bit (multi-qubit) register would allow direct investigation of quantum correlations (entanglement), and would give access to further key resources such as quantum error correction and deterministic quantum teleportation. Although spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable quantum information processing, their single-shot detection has been achieved only for isolated qubits. Here we demonstrate the preparation and measurement of a multi-spin quantum register in a low-temperature solid-state system by implementing resonant optical excitation techniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity read-out of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and use this read-out to project up to three nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can distinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto, and subsequently measuring, the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility with qubit control: we demonstrate initialization, coherent manipulation and single-shot read-out in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using techniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the way for a test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the implementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.},

abstract = {The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centre is a unique defect in diamond that possesses properties highly suited to many applications, including quantum information processing, quantum metrology, and biolabelling. Although the unique properties of the centre have been extensively documented and utilised, a detailed understanding of the physics of the centre has not yet been achieved. Indeed there persists a number of points of contention regarding the electronic structure of the centre, such as the ordering of the dark intermediate singlet states. Without a sound model of the centre's electronic structure, the understanding of the system's unique dynamical properties can not effectively progress. In this work, the molecular model of the defect centre is fully developed to provide a self consistent model of the complete electronic structure of the centre. The application of the model to describe the effects of electric, magnetic and strain interactions, as well as the variation of the centre's fine structure with temperature, provides an invaluable tool to those studying the centre and a means to design future empirical and ab initio studies of this important defect.},

abstract = {Coherence-domain imaging systems can be operated in a single-photon-counting mode, offering low detector noise; this in turn leads to increased sensitivity for weak light sources and weakly reflecting samples. We have demonstrated that excellent axial resolution can be obtained in a photon-counting coherence-domain imaging (CDI) system that uses light generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in a chirped periodically poled stoichiometric lithium tantalate (chirped-PPSLT) structure, in conjunction with a niobium nitride superconducting single-photon detector (SSPD). The bandwidth of the light generated via SPDC, as well as the bandwidth over which the SSPD is sensitive, can extend over a wavelength region that stretches from 700 to 1500 nm. This ultrabroad wavelength band offers a near-ideal combination of deep penetration and ultrahigh axial resolution for the imaging of biological tissue. The generation of SPDC light of adjustable bandwidth in the vicinity of 1064 nm, via the use of chirped-PPSLT structures, had not been previously achieved. To demonstrate the usefulness of this technique, we construct images for a hierarchy of samples of increasing complexity: a mirror, a nitrocellulose membrane, and a biological sample comprising onion-skin cells.},

abstract = {Detection of weak magnetic fields with nanoscale spatial resolution is an outstanding problem in the biological and physical sciences. For example, at a distance of 10 nm, the spin of a single electron produces a magnetic field of about 1 muT, and the corresponding field from a single proton is a few nanoteslas. A sensor able to detect such magnetic fields with nanometre spatial resolution would enable powerful applications, ranging from the detection of magnetic resonance signals from individual electron or nuclear spins in complex biological molecules to readout of classical or quantum bits of information encoded in an electron or nuclear spin memory. Here we experimentally demonstrate an approach to such nanoscale magnetic sensing, using coherent manipulation of an individual electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen-vacancy impurity in diamond at room temperature. Using an ultra-pure diamond sample, we achieve detection of 3 nT magnetic fields at kilohertz frequencies after 100 s of averaging. In addition, we demonstrate a sensitivity of 0.5 muT Hz(-1/2) for a diamond nanocrystal with a diameter of 30 nm.},

abstract = {Complete libraries of oligonucleotides were used as substrates for Thermus thermophilus DNA ligase, on a M13mp18 ssDNA template. A 17mer primer was used to start a polymerisation process. Ladders of ligation products were analysed by gel electrophoresis. Octa-, nona- and decanucleotide libraries were compared. Nonanucleotides were optimum for polymerisation and up to 15 monomers were ligated. The fidelity of incorporation was studied by sequencing 28 clones (2268 bases) of nonanucleotide polymers, 12 monomers in length. Of the ligated monomers, 79{\%} were the correct complementary sequence. In a total of 57 (2.5{\%}) mispaired bases, there was a strong bias to G.T, G.A, G.G and A.G mismatches. Of the mismatches, 86{\%} were found to be purines on the incoming oligonucleotide, of which 71{\%} were G. There is evidence for clustering of mismatches within specific 9mers and at specific positions within these 9mers. The most frequent mismatches were at the 5'-terminus of the oligonucleotide, followed by the central position. We suggest that sequence selection was imposed by the ligase and not just by base pairing interactions. The ligase directs polymerisation in the 3' to 5' direction which we propose is linked to its role in lagging strand DNA replication.},

abstract = {Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between a quantum emitter and a single radiation-field mode. When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity mode, it is possible to realize important quantum information processing tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and entanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the solid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this end. However, validating the efficacy of quantum dots in quantum information applications requires confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum-dot-cavity system in the strong-coupling regime. Here we find such confirmation by observing quantum correlations in photoluminescence from a photonic crystal nanocavity interacting with one, and only one, quantum dot located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and quantum-dot excitons is anticorrelated at the level of single quanta, proving that the mode is driven solely by the quantum dot despite an energy mismatch between cavity and excitons. When tuned to resonance, the exciton and cavity enter the strong-coupling regime of cavity QED and the quantum-dot exciton lifetime reduces by a factor of 145. The generated photon stream becomes antibunched, proving that the strongly coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum regime. Our observations unequivocally show that quantum information tasks are achievable in solid-state cavity QED.},

Without exception, quantum effects appeared only after ensemble averaging. Here, we report on a single-photon source with one, and only one, atomquasi-permanently coupled to a high-finesse cavity. ‘Quasi- permanent' refers to our ability to keep the atom long enough to, first, quantify the photon-emission statistics and, second, guarantee the subsequent performance as a single-photon server delivering up to 300,000 photons for up to 30 s. This is achieved by a unique combination of single-photon generation and atom cooling7–9 quantum information science with light and matter10–16 . Our scheme brings deterministic protocols of closer to realization.},

@article{Hennessy2007a,
abstract = {Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between a quantum emitter and a single radiation-field mode. When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity mode, it is possible to realize important quantum information processing tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and entanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the solid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this end. However, validating the efficacy of quantum dots in quantum information applications requires confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum-dot-cavity system in the strong-coupling regime. Here we find such confirmation by observing quantum correlations in photoluminescence from a photonic crystal nanocavity interacting with one, and only one, quantum dot located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and quantum-dot excitons is anticorrelated at the level of single quanta, proving that the mode is driven solely by the quantum dot despite an energy mismatch between cavity and excitons. When tuned to resonance, the exciton and cavity enter the strong-coupling regime of cavity QED and the quantum-dot exciton lifetime reduces by a factor of 145. The generated photon stream becomes antibunched, proving that the strongly coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum regime. Our observations unequivocally show that quantum information tasks are achievable in solid-state cavity QED.},

abstract = {Development of eﬃcient production methods of nanodiamond (ND) particles containing substitutional nitrogen and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) complexes remains an important goal in the nanodiamond community. ND synthesized from explosives is generally not among the preferred candidates for imaging applications owing to lack of optically active particles containing NV centers. In this paper, we have systematically studied representative classes of NDs produced by detonation shock wave conversion of diﬀerent carbon precursor materials, namely, graphite and a graphite/hexogen mixture into ND, as well as ND produced from diﬀerent combinations of explosives using diﬀerent cooling methods (wet or dry cooling). We demonstrate that (i) the N content in nanodiamond particles can be controlled through a correct selection of the carbon precursor material (addition of graphite, explosives composition); (ii) particles larger than approximately 20 nm may contain in situ produced optically active NV centers, and (iii) in ND produced from explosives, NV centers are detected only in ND produced by wet synthesis. ND synthesized from a mixture of graphite/explosive contains the largest amount of NV centers formed during synthesis and thus deserves special attention.},

abstract = {Precision metrology and quantum measurement often demand that matter be prepared in well-defined quantum states for both internal and external degrees of freedom. Laser-cooled neutral atoms localized in a deeply confining optical potential satisfy this requirement. With an appropriate choice of wavelength and polarization for the optical trap, two electronic states of an atom can experience the same trapping potential, permitting coherent control of electronic transitions independent of the atomic center-of-mass motion. Here, we review a number of recent experiments that use this approach to investigate precision quantum metrology for optical atomic clocks and coherent control of optical interactions of single atoms and photons within the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We also provide a brief survey of promising prospects for future work.},

abstract = {We present observations of quasi-phase matched parametric fluorescence in a periodically poled twin-hole silica fiber. The phase matching condition in the fiber enables the generation of a degenerate signal field in the fiber-optic communication band centered on 1556 nm. We performed coincidence measurements and a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment to validate that the signal arises from photon pairs. A coincidence peak with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 4 using 43 mW of pump power and a Hong-Ou-Mandel dip showing 40{\%} net visibility were measured. Moreover, the experiments were performed with standard single mode fibers spliced at both ends of the poled section, which makes this source easy to integrate in fiber-optic quantum communication applications.},

abstract = {Double quantum dots are convenient solid-state platforms to encode quantum information. Two-electron spin states can be detected and manipulated using quantum selection rules based on the Pauli exclusion principle, leading to Pauli spin blockade of electron transport for triplet states. Coherent spin states would be optimally preserved in an environment free of nuclear spins, which is achievable in silicon by isotopic purification. Here we report on a deliberately engineered, gate-defined silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot system. The electron occupancy of each dot and the inter-dot tunnel coupling are independently tunable by electrostatic gates. At weak inter-dot coupling we clearly observe Pauli spin blockade and measure a large intra-dot singlet-triplet splitting {\textgreater} 1 meV. The leakage current in spin blockade has a peculiar magnetic field dependence, unrelated to electron-nuclear effects and consistent with the effect of spin-flip cotunneling processes. The results obtained here provide excellent prospects for realising singlet-triplet qubits.},

abstract = {A quantum computer that stores information on two-state systems called quantum bits or qubits must be able to address and manipulate individual qubits, to effect coherent interactions between pairs of qubits, and to read out the value of qubits.1,2 Current methods for addressing qubits are divided up into spatial methods, as when a laser beam is focused on an individual qubit3,4,5 or spectral methods, as when a nuclear spin in a molecule is addressed using NMR.6,7 The density of qubits addressable spatially is limited by the wavelength of light, and the number of qubits addressable spectrally is limited by spin linewidths. Here, we propose a method for addressing qubits using a method that combines spatial and spectral selectivity. The result is a design for quantum computation that provides the potential for a density of quantum information storage and processing many orders of magnitude greater than that afforded by ion traps or NMR. Specifically, this method uses an ensemble of spectrally resolved atoms in a spectral holeburning solid. The quantum oupling is provided by strong atom-cavity interaction. Using a thin disc of diamond containing nitrogen-vacancy color centers as an example, we present an explicit model for realizing up to 300 coupled qubits in a single spot. We show how about 100 operations can take place in parallel, yielding close to 40,000 operations before decoherence.},

The device under study consists of two phosphorous nanoscale islands doped to above the metal-insulator transition, separated from each other and the source and drain reservoirs by nominally undoped (intrinsic) silicon tunnel barriers. Metallic control gates, together with an Al-AlO(x) single-electron transistor (SET), were positioned on the substrate surface, capacitively coupled to the buried dots. The individual double-dot charge states were probed using source-drain bias spectroscopy combined with non-invasive SET charge sensing. The system was measured in linear (source-drain DC bias V(SD) = 0) and non-linear (V(SD) ≠ 0) regimes, allowing calculations of the relevant capacitances. Simultaneous detection using both SET sensing and source-drain current measurements was demonstrated, providing a valuable combination for the analysis of the system. Evolution of the triple points with applied bias was observed using both charge and current sensing. Coulomb diamonds, showing the interplay between the Coulomb charging effects of the two dots, were measured using simultaneous detection and compared with numerical simulations.},

Entanglement between a single photon (signal) and a two-component ensemble of cold rubidium atoms is used to project the quantum memory element (the atomic ensemble) onto any desired state by measuring the signal in a suitable basis. The atomic qubit is read out by stimulating directional emission of a single photon (idler) from the (entangled) collective state of the ensemble. Faithful atomic memory preparation and readout are verified by the observed correlations between the signal and the idler photons. These results enable implementation of distributed quantum networking.},

abstract = {Magnetic molecules are potential building blocks for the design of spintronic devices. Moreover, molecular materials enable the combination of bottom-up processing techniques, for example with conventional top-down nanofabrication. The development of solid-state spintronic devices based on the giant magnetoresistance, tunnel magnetoresistance and spin-valve effects has revolutionized magnetic memory applications. Recently, a significant improvement of the spin-relaxation time has been observed in organic semiconductor tunnel junctions, single non-magnetic molecules coupled to magnetic electrodes have shown giant magnetoresistance and hybrid devices exploiting the quantum tunnelling properties of single-molecule magnets have been proposed. Herein, we present an original spin-valve device in which a non-magnetic molecular quantum dot, made of a single-walled carbon nanotube contacted with non-magnetic electrodes, is laterally coupled through supramolecular interactions to TbPc(2) single-molecule magnets (Pc=phthalocyanine). Their localized magnetic moments lead to a magnetic field dependence of the electrical transport through the single-walled carbon nanotube, resulting in magnetoresistance ratios up to 300{\%} at temperatures less than 1 K. We thus demonstrate the functionality of a supramolecular spin valve without magnetic leads. Our results open up prospects of new spintronic devices with quantum properties.},

By using a microscopic optical resonator, we achieved such interactions and demonstrated a robust, efficient mechanism for the regulated transport of photons one by one. With critical coupling of the input light, a single atom within the resonator dynamically controls the cavity output conditioned on the photon number at the input, thereby functioning as a photon turnstile. We verified the transformation from a Poissonian to a sub-Poissonian photon stream by photon counting measurements of the input and output fields. The results have applications in quantum information science, including for controlled interactions of single light quanta and for scalable quantum processing on atom chips.},

The qubit consists of a single (13)C nuclear spin in the vicinity of a nitrogen-vacancy color center within an isotopically purified diamond crystal. The long qubit memory time was achieved via a technique involving dissipative decoupling of the single nuclear spin from its local environment.

abstract = {Quantum networks are composed of quantum nodes that interact coherently through quantum channels, and open a broad frontier of scientific opportunities. For example, a quantum network can serve as a 'web' for connecting quantum processors for computation and communication, or as a 'simulator' allowing investigations of quantum critical phenomena arising from interactions among the nodes mediated by the channels. The physical realization of quantum networks generically requires dynamical systems capable of generating and storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories, and efficiently transferring stored entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across the network. Although such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse bipartite systems, entangled states have not been achieved for interconnects capable of 'mapping' multipartite entanglement stored in quantum memories to quantum channels. Here we demonstrate measurement-induced entanglement stored in four atomic memories; user-controlled, coherent transfer of the atomic entanglement to four photonic channels; and characterization of the full quadripartite entanglement using quantum uncertainty relations. Our work therefore constitutes an advance in the distribution of multipartite entanglement across quantum networks. We also show that our entanglement verification method is suitable for studying the entanglement order of condensed-matter systems in thermal equilibrium.},

abstract = {We use single-spin resonant spectroscopy to study the spin structure in the orbital excited state of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center at room temperature. The data show that the excited-state spin levels have a zero-field splitting that is approximately half of the value of the ground state levels, a g factor similar to the ground state value, and a hyperfine splitting 20 larger than in the ground state. In addition, the width of the resonances reflects the electronic lifetime in the excited state.We also show that the spin level splitting can significantly differ between N-V centers, likely due to the effects of local strain, which provides a pathway to control over the spin Hamiltonian and may be useful for quantum- information processing.},

abstract = {The size of silicon transistors used in microelectronic devices is shrinking to the level at which quantum effects become important. Although this presents a significant challenge for the further scaling of microprocessors, it provides the potential for radical innovations in the form of spin-based quantum computers and spintronic devices. An electron spin in silicon can represent a well-isolated quantum bit with long coherence times because of the weak spin-orbit coupling and the possibility of eliminating nuclear spins from the bulk crystal. However, the control of single electrons in silicon has proved challenging, and so far the observation and manipulation of a single spin has been impossible. Here we report the demonstration of single-shot, time-resolved readout of an electron spin in silicon. This has been performed in a device consisting of implanted phosphorus donors coupled to a metal-oxide-semiconductor single-electron transistor-compatible with current microelectronic technology. We observed a spin lifetime of ∼6 seconds at a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla, and achieved a spin readout fidelity better than 90 per cent. High-fidelity single-shot spin readout in silicon opens the way to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices, built using the most important material in the semiconductor industry.},

The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scientific capabilities for generating and characterizing quantum coherence and entanglement. Fundamental to this endeavour are quantum interconnects, which convert quantum states from one physical system to those of another in a reversible manner. Such quantum connectivity in networks can be achieved by the optical interactions of single photons and atoms, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the network and the teleportation of quantum states between nodes.},

Under appropriate conditions, we find ensemble NV spin coherence times (T{\_}2) comparable to that of single NVs, with T{\_}2 {\textgreater} 600 microseconds for a sample with natural abundance of 13C and paramagnetic impurity density {\~{}}10{\^{}}15 cm{\^{}}(-3). We also observe a sharp decrease of the coherence time with misalignment of the static magnetic field relative to the NV electronic spin axis, consistent with theoretical modeling of NV coupling to a 13C nuclear spin bath. The long coherence times and increased signal-to-noise provided by room-temperature NV ensembles will aid many applications of NV centers in precision magnetometry and quantum information.},

abstract = {We present an example of quantum process tomography (QPT) performed on a single solid-state qubit. The qubit used is two energy levels of the triplet state in the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. QPT is applied to a qubit which has been allowed to decohere for three different time periods. In each case, the process is found in terms of the $\chi$ matrix representation and the affine map representation. The discrepancy between experimentally estimated process and the closest physically valid process is noted. The results of QPT performed after three different decoherence times are used to find the error generators, or Lindblad operators, for the system, using the technique introduced by Boulant et al (2003 Phys. Rev. A 67 042322).},

abstract = {We propose a quantum-information processor that consists of decoherence-free logical qubits encoded into arrays of dipole-coupled qubits. High-fidelity single-qubit operations are performed deterministically within a decoherence-free subsystem without leakage via global addressing of bichromatic laser fields. Two-qubit operations are realized locally with four physical qubits, and between separated logical qubits using linear optics. We show how to prepare cluster states using this method. We include all non-nearest-neighbor effects in our calculations, and we assume the qubits are not located in the Dicke limit. Although our proposal is general to any system of dipole-coupled qubits, throughout the paper we use nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as an experimental context for our theoretical results.},

@article{Mitchell2004,
abstract = {Interference phenomena are ubiquitous in physics, often forming the basis of demanding measurements. Examples include Ramsey interferometry in atomic spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction in crystallography and optical interferometry in gravitational-wave studies. It has been known for some time that the quantum property of entanglement can be exploited to perform super-sensitive measurements, for example in optical interferometry or atomic spectroscopy. The idea has been demonstrated for an entangled state of two photons, but for larger numbers of particles it is difficult to create the necessary multiparticle entangled states. Here we demonstrate experimentally a technique for producing a maximally entangled three-photon state from initially non-entangled photons. The method can in principle be applied to generate states of arbitrary photon number, giving arbitrarily large improvement in measurement resolution. The method of state construction requires non-unitary operations, which we perform using post-selected linear-optics techniques similar to those used for linear-optics quantum computing.},

abstract = {We propose a new technique, called quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT), for carrying out tomographic measurements with dispersion-cancelled resolution. The technique can also be used to extract the frequency-dependent refractive index of the medium. QOCT makes use of a two-photon interferometer in which a swept delay permits a coincidence interferogram to be traced. The technique bears a resemblance to classical optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, it makes use of a nonclassical entangled twin-photon light source that permits measurements to be made at depths greater than those accessible via OCT, which suffers from the deleterious effects of sample dispersion. Aside from the dispersion cancellation, QOCT offers higher sensitivity than OCT as well as an enhancement of resolution by a factor of 2 for the same source bandwidth. QOCT and OCT are compared using an idealized sample.},

By using these ultrabroadband biphotons (300-nm bandwidth), we measure the narrowest Hong-Ou-Mandel dip to date, having a full width at half maximum of 7.1 fs. This enables the generation of a high flux of nonoverlapping biphotons with ultrabroad bandwidth, thereby promoting the use of SPDC light in many nonclassical applications.},

It has been shown, however, that by using multi-photon quantum states of the light field, and multi-photon sensitive material or detector, this limit can be surpassed. We give a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of this problem, address some particularly widespread misconceptions and discuss the requirements for turning the research on quantum imaging into a practical technology.},
